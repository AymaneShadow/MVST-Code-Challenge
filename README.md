## Short Description

This project is about displaying the basic info and public repositories of a Github account and allowing the user to filter through the repositories by name or language using a search bar, or name or last update time using the provided sort options.

## Instructions on how to run it

1 - Clone this repo to your desired destination.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AymaneShadow/MVST-Code-Challenge.git
```

2 - Install the npm packages by running the following command in the root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

2 - Run the project using the following command in the root directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Instructions on how to run the test suite

No tests were implemented.

## Future improvements

This project can be improved in so many ways. Here are a few ideas:

- The search and sort now are completely independent. One idea could be to combine searching and sorting and / or combine multiple sorts (e.g. language + last updated on).
- The design of the UI could be further refined to resemble Github to a greater extent.
